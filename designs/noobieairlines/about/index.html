        <ul class="para-1">
            <li>Welcome to Noobie Airlines, the top rated airline in the world! We have an estimated kill count of over 1M+ people, which is absolutely insane. We make that God Tier members get the best experience out of all the other people because they're rich like heck and everyone else isn't. We give out coffee and chocolate cake all the time, and we also have major parties like blowing up the plane which is extremely fun! If you're a God Tier member, you get to sit on the top of the plane with no air, and free flying! One of our customers, Jonathan Deez, said he had one of the best experiences in his life while flying! We also beat our original amount of money from $0.01 to -$1000, we are stonking on the money right now! <a href="/#">Back to Website!</a></a></li>

            <li>This is our national anthem, we chant to this song everytime we are on the plane. It's one of the <strong>BEST</strong> songs in the world. If you don't like this song, you will be abandoned from the plane, that's our ONE rule on Noobie Airlines. On Noobie Airlines, there are no seatbelts. We don't need them.</li>
        </ul>
        <ul class="para-3">
            <li>If you go on Noobie Airlines, theres a 150% chance that you will die, but it's fine because it is the best experience for absolutely anyone. We highly support everyone that comes onboard by stabbing them with a diamond sword and forcing them into parties with about 150,000 other people. We haven't been sponsored by anyone yet, so if you are able to get your company to sponsor us, that would really help us out! Our main objectives is to get sponsored by Minecraft Awesome Parodies, but that hasn't quiet happened yet :(. We have been sponsored by the White House before and you can actually meet the president onboard (if you have god tier)</li>
